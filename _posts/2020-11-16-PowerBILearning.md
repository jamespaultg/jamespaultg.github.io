## Performance
Check out [the tip](https://alluringbi.com/2020/08/06/consolidating-report-elements-for-improved-performance/) from [Chris Hamill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hamill17/) on improving performance of your Power BI report
- Every visual(shapes, textbot, charts) impacts performance
- Performance can be monitored using Performance Analyzer
- Reduce the number of visuals (Note: A bunch of card visuals can be replaced by well formatted Matrix)
